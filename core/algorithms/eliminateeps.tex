%{\bf CONTAINS KNOWN BUGS}

Given an epsilon tensor and a self-dual tensor contracted with it,
rewrite the self-dual tensor as epsilon times itself.
\begin{screen}{1,2}
F_{m n p}::SelfDual.
\eps_{m n p q r s}::EpsilonTensor.
\eps_{m n p q r s} F_{q r s};
@eliminateeps!(%){F_{m n p}};
\end{screen}
At a further stage one can then use the
command \subscommand{epsprod2gendelta} to remove the epsilons
altogether the arguments contain a list of all tensors for which
self-duality can be applied). Uses the the tensor with the largest
number of indices in common with the epsilon symbol (can be more than
one, in which case more terms are generated).
