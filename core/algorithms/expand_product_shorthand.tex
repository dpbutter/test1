\cdbalgorithm{expand\_product\_shorthand}{}

Reverse of the \subscommand{product\_shorthand} algorithm. In addition
to the two tensor names, it takes a number denoting the total number
of indices.
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,5}
F_{m n p q}::Symmetric.
G_{m n p q}::Symmetric.
@product_shorthand![ F_{a b c d} G_{a b d f} ]{F}{G};
F_{c} G_{f};
@expand_product_shorthand!(%){F}{G}{4};
F_{c a b d} G_{f a b d};
\end{screen}
Note that writing a product as a shorthand and then expanding again
may re-order the indices, as in the example above.
