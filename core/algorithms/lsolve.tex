\cdbalgorithm{lsolve}{}

Solve a system of linear equations over integers. Example,
\begin{screen}{1,2}
{ a0+2*a2 + a3= 3, -a0 - a2 + a3= - (8/3) , a3 = 3};
@lsolve(%){a0,a2,a3};
{a0 = 34/3, a2 = (-17/3), a3 = 3};
\end{screen}
Underdetermined and inconsistent systems are handled as expected:
either some coefficients are left unfixed or the system is returned
and an error message is printed.
