\cdbalgorithm{product\_shorthand}{}

Rewrites the product of two fully symmetric or anti-symmetric tensors
in a compact form by removing the contracting dummy indices.
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
F_{m n p q}::Symmetric.
G_{m n p q}::Symmetric.
@product_shorthand![ F_{a b c d} G_{a b d f} ]{F}{G};
F_{c} G_{f};
\end{screen}
The two arguments denote the tensors to which the algorithm should
apply. Expanding the product again in terms of the full tensors can be
done with the algorithm \subscommand{expand\_product\_shorthand}.
