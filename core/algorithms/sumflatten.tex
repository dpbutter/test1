\cdbalgorithm{sumflatten}{}

Removes brackets in a sum, that is, makes changes of the type
\begin{equation}
a+(b+c) \rightarrow a+b+c\, .
\end{equation}
In terms of code this reads
\begin{screen}{1,2}
a + (b + c);
@sumflatten!(%);
a + b + c;
\end{screen}
The above is sometimes required because it is possible to write and
keep nested sums with brackets, like in the example above, in order to
improve readability of expressions.
