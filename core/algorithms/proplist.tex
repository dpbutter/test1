Show all properties and the patterns to which they are
associated. Note that this includes all default properties for objects
like {\tt $\backslash prod$}.
\begin{screen}{1,2}
{A,B}::AntiCommuting.
A_{m n}::Symmetric.
@proplist;
\sum{#}::CommutingAsSum
\prod{#}::IndexInherit
\prod{#}::Distributable
...

\end{screen}
A list of all available properties (not necessarily attached to any
object) is instead obtained using \subscommand{properties}.
