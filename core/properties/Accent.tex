\cdbproperty{Accent}{}

Turns a symbol into an accent. Accented objects inherit all properties
and indices from the objects which they wrap. Here is an example with
inherited coordinate dependence:
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,4,5,6}
\hat{#}::Accent.
\partial{#}::PartialDerivative.
A::Depends(\partial).
\partial(A \hat{A} B):
@prodrule!(%):
@unwrap!(%);
\partial(A) * A * B + A * \partial(\hat{A}) * B;
\end{screen}
Without the accent property, \verb|\hat{A}| object would be a
completely independent object, unrelated to \verb|A|.
