\cdbproperty{AntiSelfDual}{}

Make a tensor fully anti-symmetric as well as anti-selfdual. The
conventions used are that self-duality means
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu_1\cdots \mu_n}
= - \frac{1}{n!} \epsilon_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_n \mu_{n+1}\cdots \mu_{2n}} F_{\mu_{n+1}\cdots\mu_{2n}}\,.
\end{equation}
This property used by the Young projection algorithms and
the \subscommand{dualise\_tensor} algorithm, among others.
