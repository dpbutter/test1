\cdbproperty{IndexInherit}{}

Indicates that an object should inherit the indices of its child
objects. This is useful mainly for operators. Matrix transposition,
for instance, could be written as 
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
T{#}::IndexInherit.
T(B_{m n}) + C_{m n};
\end{screen}
Without the \subsprop{IndexInherit} property, the object 
\verb|T(B_{m n})| would be considered a scalar, without indices, and an index mismatch
error would be reported. With the property, the first term has
external indices \verb|m| and \verb|n|, just like the second term.

This property is automatically associated to all \subsprop{Derivative} operators.
