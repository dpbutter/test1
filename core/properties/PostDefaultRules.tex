\cdbproperty{PostDefaultRules}{}

Set the default rules, to be applied \emph{after} every new input has
been processed and active nodes have been executed. Use the inert form
of active nodes for those ones that only have to be come active upon
actual evaluation of the rule,
i.e.~\inertcommand{collect\_terms!(\%)}. Here is an example containing
more than one rule:
\begin{screen}{1,2}
::PostDefaultRules( @@distribute!(%), @@prodsort!(%), @@collect_terms!(%) ).
A*(B+C) + B*(A+C);
2 A B + A C + B C;
\end{screen}
Note that the rules have to be given in order; the list will only be
traversed once.
