\cdbproperty{Spinor}{\it dimension={\sf integer},
type=Weyl$\vert$Majorana$\vert$MajoranaWeyl, chirality=Positive$\vert$Negative}

Declares an object to be a spinor, i.e.~transforming in one of the
spinor representations of the orthogonal or Lorentz group. The
declaration should involve an indication of the dimension, as in the
example below. It can optionally have type indicators (these should be
{\tt Majorana}, {\tt Weyl} or {\tt MajoranaWeyl}) and chirality
indicators for Weyl spinors ({\tt Positive} or {\tt Negative},
indicating the eigenvalue with respect to the generalised~$\gamma_5$
matrix). Here is an example:
\begin{screen}{1,2}
\psi::Spinor(dimension=11, type=Majorana).
\end{screen}
This property is taken into account by various algorithms such
as \subscommand{fierz} and \subscommand{spinorsort}.
