\cdbproperty{KroneckerDelta}{}

Denotes a generalised Kronecker
  delta symbol. When the symbol carries two indices, it is the usual
  Kronecker delta. When the number of indices is larger, the meaning
  is
\begin{equation}
\delta_{m_1}{}^{n_1}{}_{m_2}{}^{n_2}{}_{\ldots m_k}{}^{n_k} =
\delta_{[m 1}{}^{n_1} \delta_{m_2}{}^{n_2} \cdots \delta_{m_k]}{}^{n_k} \,,
\end{equation}
with unit weight anti-symmetrisation.  

A symbol which is declared as a
Kronecker delta has the property that it can be taken in and out of
derivatives. The algorithm \subscommand{eliminate\_kr} eliminates
normal Kronecker deltas by appropriately renaming indices (in order to
eliminate Kronecker deltas with more than two indices, first
use \subscommand{breakgendelta}).
