\cdbproperty{Distributable}{}

 Makes an object distributable. When
  the object has a sum as argument, it can be distributed over the
  terms with \subscommand{distribute}, as in
\begin{screen}{1,2,3}
\hat{#}::Distributable.
\hat{A+B+C D}:
@distribute!(%);
\hat{A} + \hat{B} + \hat{C D};
\end{screen}
